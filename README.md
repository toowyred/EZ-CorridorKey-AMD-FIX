# EZ-CorridorKey **v1.8.0** AMD-FIX by toowyred

> **Latest release: [v1.8.0](https://github.com/edenaion/EZ-CorridorKey/releases/tag/v1.8.0)** — A/B wipe comparison, F-key view hotkeys, Docker browser mode, model resolution control. See the [full changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

A full desktop GUI for [Niko Pueringer's CorridorKey](https://github.com/nikopueringer/CorridorKey) — the AI green screen keyer by Corridor Digital that physically unmixes foreground from background, preserving hair, motion blur, and translucency.

This GUI replaces the CLI drag-and-drop workflow with a complete desktop application while preserving 100% backward compatibility (`python main.py --cli` still runs the original wizard).

## Installation

**One-Click Install (Windows / macOS / Linux):**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. The one-click path provisions and uses managed Python 3.11 automatically, so you do not need to pre-install Python just to use `1-install`.
3. Run the installer for your platform:
   - **Windows:** Double-click `1-install.bat`
   - **macOS / Linux:** `chmod +x 1-install.sh && ./1-install.sh`
4. The installer handles everything: managed Python, virtual environment, dependencies (including the correct PyTorch backend for your GPU when available), verification, and model downloads.
5. To launch: double-click `2-start.bat` (Windows) or `./2-start.sh` (macOS/Linux).

**Prerequisites:**

- For the one-click installer: no preinstalled Python required
- For manual installs: [Python 3.10–3.13](https://python.org) (3.14 is not yet supported)
- **Windows/Linux:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (8 GB+ VRAM recommended). Keep your driver current — the installer verifies the torch runtime and will stop with diagnostics instead of silently leaving you on the wrong backend.
- **macOS:** Apple Silicon (M1+). CorridorKey inference runs natively via MLX (1.5–2x faster than MPS). GPU-intensive alpha generators (SAM2, GVM, VideoMaMa, MatAnyone2) run on MPS but are significantly slower — importing pre-made alpha mattes is recommended on Mac.

### 🔴 AMD Radeon GPU Setup (Crucial) by toowyred for the AMD/Portability patch
If you are using an AMD GPU (e.g., RX 7900 XTX), the standard installer defaults to CPU-only mode to prevent driver crashes. To unlock Hybrid GPU Acceleration (CPU Backbone + GPU Refiner), follow these steps after the initial install:

1. **Run the AMD Installer:**
Double-click 1-install-amd.bat. This automatically cleans up NVIDIA-specific packages and installs the optimized DirectML runtime, which includes:
   `python -m venv .venv`
   `".venv\Scripts\activate"`
   `python -m pip install torch-directml torchvision numpy PySide6 timm transformers` and runs `export_to_onnx.py` (a custom "split-engine")

2. **Launch:** Use `2-start.bat`.
   
3. **Native AMD Diagnostics:** Updated the diagnostic system to recognize DirectML hardware natively. Instead of a "GPU Required" error, you will now see a clean informational checklist verifying your setup:

| Before (NVIDIA-only Check) | After (DirectML Native Detection) |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![Before](dev-docs/guides/screenshots/GPU-warning-on-AMD-before.png) | ![After](dev-docs/guides/screenshots/GPU-warning-on-AMD-after.png) |

**Note on Performance:**

Split Engine: The first inference pass after launch will be slow (~20-40s) while DirectML compiles custom shaders for your card. Subsequent frames will be significantly faster.

NVIDIA-Exclusive Features: GVM and VideoMaMa still require CUDA. For those specific workflows, use manual alpha hints or the "Import Alpha" feature.


**What the installer does:**

- Checks for [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (C++ compiler needed by OpenEXR) — offers to auto-install if missing
- Installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and provisions managed Python 3.11 for the installer path
- Creates a `.venv` virtual environment in the project folder
- Installs the correct PyTorch backend for your platform/GPU and verifies the resulting torch runtime before reporting success
- Downloads and installs [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) locally if not found on PATH (used for video import)
- Downloads the CorridorKey model checkpoint (383 MB, required)
- Optionally installs SAM2 tracking support and pre-downloads the default Base+ checkpoint (324 MB)
- Optionally downloads GVM (~6 GB) and VideoMaMa (~37 GB) alpha hint generators
- Creates a desktop shortcut (optional)

**Updating:**

- **Windows:** Double-click `3-update.bat`
- **macOS / Linux:** `./3-update.sh`

### Alternate Installation: Docker

For Linux users or remote/cloud setups, EZ-CorridorKey can run inside Docker with browser-based access via noVNC. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for setup instructions. The native install above is recommended for Windows and macOS.

## Quick Start

### 1. Import

Drop a video file onto the welcome screen (or File > Import Clips > Import Video). The video is automatically extracted to a high-quality image sequence:

1. **FFmpeg extracts** each frame as **EXR half-float** (ZIP16 compression)
2. **Recompression pass** converts ZIP16 → **DWAB** (VFX-standard lossy compression, ~4× smaller)

This two-pass approach preserves full floating-point precision from the video decoder — no 8-bit quantization, no banding. Even 8-bit source video benefits because FFmpeg's internal YUV→RGB conversion stays in float, avoiding rounding errors that accumulate in integer pipelines. The DWAB-compressed EXR frames are typically comparable in size to PNG while retaining 16-bit half-float dynamic range.

The recompression runs in a separate process so the UI stays fully responsive during extraction.

### 2. Generate Alpha Hint

Your clip starts in **RAW** state (gray badge). You need an alpha hint before running inference.

**Option A — GVM Auto (one-click):**
Click **GVM AUTO** in the parameter panel. Works great for most green screen footage with people.

**Option B — Track Mask + MatAnyone2 / VideoMaMa:**
For difficult shots, use the paint brush as a prompt tool:

1. Press **1** to activate foreground mode (green)
2. Paint over the subject on a few key frames
3. Press **2** to switch to background mode (red)
4. Paint over background areas
5. Click **TRACK MASK** to generate a dense SAM2 mask track
6. Click **MATANYONE2** or **VIDEOMAMA** in the parameter panel

**Option C — Import Alpha (bring your own):**
If you already have alpha mattes from another tool (Rotobrush, Silhouette, Resolve, Nuke, etc.), click **IMPORT ALPHA** in the parameter panel and choose either an image folder or a matte video file.

- Supported image formats: **PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIF, TIFF, EXR**
- Supported alpha-video path: standard video files accepted by the normal clip importer (for example **MOV** or **MP4**)
- Images and visible matte videos should be **grayscale** (white = foreground, black = background)
- Frame count should match your input sequence
- Non-PNG stills are automatically converted to grayscale PNG on import
- Imported alpha videos are decoded into grayscale `AlphaHint/*.png` frames so they follow the same downstream path as image-sequence hints
- Imported files are copied into the clip's `AlphaHint/` folder and the clip advances to **READY** state

You can re-import at any time — if the clip already has alpha hints, you'll be asked whether to overwrite them.

### 3. Run Inference

Your clip is now **READY** (yellow badge). Adjust parameters as needed, then click **RUN INFERENCE** (or **Ctrl+R**).

### Batch Pipeline (Unattended)

Select multiple clips in the I/O tray (Ctrl+click or Shift+click), then click **RUN PIPELINE** in the status bar. The system automatically:

1. Detects each clip's state and paint strokes
2. Runs **TRACK MASK** and then **VideoMaMa** for painted clips
3. Runs **GVM Auto** for unpainted RAW clips
4. Chains **inference** after each alpha generation completes

The entire pipeline is cancellable (Esc) and checkpointable — if interrupted, restarting picks up where each clip left off.

### 4. Review

Switch between view modes to inspect results:

- **COMP** — key over checkerboard
- **FG** — check for green fringing
- **MATTE** — inspect alpha quality
- **PROCESSED** — production RGBA

Outputs are written to the project's `Output/` subdirectories during inference.

## Inference Controls

| Control              | Range        | Default    | Description                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color Space**      | sRGB, Linear | sRGB       | How CorridorKey interprets the input before inference |
| **Despill Strength** | 0.0 – 1.0    | 1.0        | Green spill removal intensity                         |
| **Despeckle**        | 50 – 2000 px | ON, 400 px | Removes isolated artifacts smaller than threshold     |
| **Refiner Scale**    | 0.0 – 3.0    | 1.0        | Edge refinement. 0 = disabled                         |
| **Live Preview**     | —            | ON         | Reprocess current frame when parameters change        |

**Color Space behavior**

- The **left INPUT viewer** always shows CorridorKey's current interpretation of the source. If the input looks wrong there, your future inference results and exports will be based on that wrong interpretation too.
- Changing **Color Space** before clicking **RUN INFERENCE** affects how the next live preview and the next export run are generated.
- Changing **Color Space** after outputs already exist does **not** rewrite those files on disk. It only updates the viewer and live preview. To keep that new interpretation in saved files, rerun inference.
- CorridorKey auto-detects color space from file type and metadata when possible, but you can override it if the INPUT viewer does not look representative.
- With **Live Preview** enabled, the first adjustment after a fresh launch may pause briefly while the inference engine loads.

**Middle-click** any slider to reset it to default.

### Output Format

Each output channel can be individually enabled and set to EXR or PNG:

| Output        | Default | Format | Description                                             |
| ------------- | ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FG**        | ON      | EXR    | Foreground RGB with spill removed                       |
| **Matte**     | ON      | EXR    | Single-channel alpha                                    |
| **Comp**      | ON      | PNG    | Key over checkerboard (for review)                      |
| **Processed** | ON      | EXR    | Full RGBA straight linear (for Resolve and compositing) |

---

## Status Colors

| Color  | State      | Meaning                                   |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Orange | EXTRACTING | Video being extracted to image sequence   |
| Gray   | RAW        | Frames loaded, no alpha hint yet          |
| Blue   | MASKED     | Paint masks created (ready for VideoMaMa) |
| Yellow | READY      | Alpha hint available, ready for inference |
| Green  | COMPLETE   | Inference finished, outputs available     |
| Red    | ERROR      | Processing failed — can retry             |

---

## Frame Scrubber

The scrubber below the dual viewer provides:

- **Transport buttons:** First frame, step back, play/pause, step forward, last frame
- **Playback is CAPPED:** Pressing spacebar will play back footage at a hardcoded rate of 3FPS. This is intentional, the files are large.
- **Coverage bar:** Three color-coded lanes showing which frames have paint strokes (green), alpha hints (white), and inference output (yellow)
- **In/Out markers:** Press **I** / **O** to set a sub-range for processing. When set, the RUN button changes to "RUN SELECTED" and playback loops within the range.

## Project Structure

Each imported clip creates a project folder:

```

| **VRAM** | 8 GB          | 12 GB              | 16 GB+                        |
| **GPU**  | NVIDIA (CUDA) | Ampere+ (RTX 30xx) | Ada/Blackwell (RTX 40xx/50xx) |

#### VRAM modes

| Mode                  | VRAM usage | 4K speed    | How it works                             |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Speed** (≥12 GB)    | ~8.7 GB    | ~1.5s/frame | Full-frame refiner, full torch.compile   |
| **Low-VRAM** (<12 GB) | ~2.5 GB    | ~1.6s/frame | 512×512 tiled refiner, selective compile |

Mode is auto-detected from available VRAM. Override with `CORRIDORKEY_OPT_MODE=speed|lowvram|auto`.

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

|             | Minimum       | Recommended                                      |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Chip**    | M1 (8 GB)     | M1 Pro+ (16 GB+)                                 |
| **Backend** | MPS (PyTorch) | MLX (auto-detected if corridorkey-mlx installed) |

CorridorKey inference auto-selects the fastest available backend: MLX (1.5–2x faster) when `corridorkey-mlx` and a `.safetensors` checkpoint are present, otherwise PyTorch MPS. Override with `CORRIDORKEY_BACKEND=torch|mlx|auto`.

Alpha generators (SAM2, GVM, VideoMaMa, MatAnyone2) always run on PyTorch MPS — no MLX ports exist for these models. For best Mac experience, import pre-made alpha mattes from After Effects, DaVinci Resolve, or Nuke.

## Quality Verification

EZ-CorridorKey's optimizations (Hiera FlashAttention, TF32 tensor cores, torch.compile, tiled refiner) produce output identical to upstream CorridorKey within float32 noise floor — verified across PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, LPIPS, and DeltaE 2000.
